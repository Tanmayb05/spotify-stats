## What Was Implemented

### Purpose
Enable users to analyze their listening moods over time based on Spotify's audio features: valence (happiness), energy, and danceability. Provide insights into mood patterns across different contexts.

### Features
- Spotify API integration for fetching audio features
- Background job to enrich streaming data with audio features
- Mood summary with configurable time windows (7d, 30d, 90d, all)
- Monthly mood trend charts showing valence, energy, and danceability over time
- Mood ring visualization with circular progress indicators
- Context-based comparisons: weekday vs weekend
- Platform-based mood analysis
- Interactive window selector for different time periods

### Implementation
- Created SpotifyAPIClient class with search and audio features methods
- Implemented caching mechanism for audio features to minimize API calls
- Added rate limiting and bulk fetching capabilities
- Extended SpotifyDataLoader with mood analysis methods (get_mood_summary, get_mood_contexts, get_mood_monthly)
- Created mood API router with three endpoints: /api/mood/summary, /api/mood/contexts, /api/mood/monthly
- Built enrichment job script with progress tracking and resume capability
- Implemented Moods page with LineChart for trends, BarChart for comparisons
- Added mood ring using Material-UI CircularProgress components
- Integrated time window selector with state management

### Flow
- User obtains Spotify API credentials from developer.spotify.com
- User configures backend/.env with SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
- User runs enrichment job: python3 -m backend.jobs.enrich_audio_features
- Job fetches audio features for all unique tracks and caches in data/audio_features.json
- Backend loads cached audio features on startup
- User navigates to Moods page in the webapp
- Frontend fetches mood data for selected time window
- Charts display valence, energy, and danceability metrics
- User can compare moods across weekdays/weekends and platforms

### Usage
- Set up Spotify API: Create app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
- Configure backend/.env with credentials (use backend/.env.example as template)
- Run enrichment job: python3 -m backend.jobs.enrich_audio_features
- Restart backend to load new audio features
- Navigate to Moods page in the webapp
- Select time window from dropdown (7d, 30d, 90d, or all time)
- View mood ring with current averages
- Explore monthly trends and context comparisons

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 3: Artist Discovery & Reflective Insights
- Add discovery timeline showing when new artists were first played
- Calculate artist loyalty metrics and half-life
- Identify "obsession" periods with high concentration on specific artists
- Generate reflective insight cards based on listening patterns

## Conclusion
Phase 2 successfully integrates Spotify audio features to provide deep mood analysis. Users can now understand their listening emotional patterns over time and across different contexts. The enrichment job and caching system ensure efficient API usage while maintaining data freshness.
