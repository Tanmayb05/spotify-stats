# Session Segmentation & Clustering — Phase 5
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Completed
**Time to complete:** ~120 minutes

## Overview
Phase 5 implements intelligent session segmentation and clustering using machine learning. The system automatically groups streaming records into listening sessions using a 30-minute gap threshold, extracts multi-dimensional features from each session, and applies k-means clustering with automatic optimal cluster selection via silhouette score analysis. This reveals distinct listening patterns such as "Quick Listens," "Deep Dives," "Discovery Sessions," and more.

## What Was Implemented

### Purpose
The Session Clustering feature uses unsupervised machine learning to automatically discover and categorize different types of listening behavior. Instead of manually defining session types, the algorithm learns patterns from the data itself, identifying clusters like:
- **Quick Listens**: Short sessions with few tracks
- **Deep Dives**: Long, focused listening with low skip rates
- **Discovery Sessions**: High artist diversity, exploratory behavior
- **Background Music**: Longer duration, moderate skip rates
- **Focused Listening**: Specific time patterns, low diversity

This provides users with data-driven insights into their listening habits without requiring subjective categorization.

### Features

#### 1. Session Segmentation (30-min Gap Threshold)
- **Automatic Sessionization**: Groups continuous listening periods separated by <30 minutes
- **Minimum Session Length**: Requires 3+ tracks to qualify as a session
- **Chronological Processing**: Maintains temporal ordering for accurate gap detection
- **Feature Rich**: Each session captures 8 key features for clustering:
  - Duration (minutes)
  - Track count
  - Unique artists count
  - Skip ratio (%)
  - Average track play duration
  - Hour of day (0-23)
  - Weekend indicator (0/1)
  - Diversity score (unique artists / total tracks)

#### 2. K-Means Clustering with Optimal K Selection
- **Silhouette Score Optimization**: Tests k=2 through k=min(8, n_sessions/10)
- **StandardScaler Normalization**: Ensures features contribute equally regardless of scale
- **Reproducible Results**: Fixed random_state=42 for consistent clustering
- **Quality Metrics**: Silhouette score provided to assess clustering quality (0-1 scale)
- **Minimum Session Requirement**: Requires 10+ sessions for meaningful clustering

#### 3. Cluster Profiles
- **Centroid Visualization**: Horizontal bar charts showing feature values for each cluster
- **Named Clusters**: Human-readable names like "Quick Listens", "Deep Dives", etc.
- **Color-Coded**: Each cluster assigned a brand color (Emerald, Keppel, Aquamarine, etc.)
- **Aggregate Statistics**:
  - Session count per cluster
  - Average duration
  - Average track count
  - Average skip ratio
  - Average diversity score
  - Common listening hour
  - Weekend vs weekday ratio

#### 4. Session Assignments Table
- **Recent Sessions**: Displays 50 most recent sessions with cluster labels
- **Color-Coded Chips**: Cluster labels shown as colored chips matching profile colors
- **Detailed Metrics**: Duration, track count, skip rate, diversity, platform
- **Sortable & Filterable**: Uses DataTable component with full keyboard accessibility
- **Timestamp Display**: Shows start time in readable format (Month Day, HH:MM)

#### 5. Clustering Overview Dashboard
- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Total sessions analyzed
  - Number of clusters found
  - Clustering quality score (silhouette × 100%)
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons for Groups, TrendingUp, Science
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles insufficient data scenarios

### Implementation

#### Backend Implementation

**Session Segmentation** (`_build_sessions()`):
1. Sorts all streaming records chronologically
2. Iterates through records, tracking time gaps
3. When gap > 30 minutes, saves current session and starts new one
4. Filters sessions with <3 tracks
5. Returns list of sessions with extracted features

**Feature Extraction** (`_extract_session_features()`):
- Calculates 8 numerical features for each session
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Rounds values for cleaner display
- Includes platform detection for context

**Clustering Algorithm** (`_cluster_sessions()`):
```python
1. Build sessions from streaming data
2. Extract feature matrix (n_sessions × 8 features)
3. Normalize features with StandardScaler
4. Test k=2 to k=max_k:
   a. Fit KMeans with k clusters
   b. Calculate silhouette score
   c. Track best k
5. Perform final clustering with optimal k
6. Transform centroids back to original scale
7. Assign cluster labels to all sessions
```

**Endpoints** (`sessions.py`):
- `GET /api/sessions/clusters` - Returns cluster profiles and statistics
- `GET /api/sessions/centroids` - Returns centroid feature values
- `GET /api/sessions/assignments?limit=100` - Returns recent sessions with labels
