## What Was Implemented

### Purpose
Enable users to track their journey of discovering new artists, understand listening loyalty patterns, identify obsession periods, and gain reflective insights about their music consumption habits.

### Features
- **Discovery Timeline**: Line chart showing new artists discovered per month
- **Artist Loyalty Table**:
  - Return probability percentage (inverse of average gap between listens)
  - Half-life in days (median gap - time until 50% likely to return)
  - Total streams per artist
  - Sortable, keyboard-accessible table with sticky headers
- **Obsession Periods**: Horizontal bar chart showing weeks where an artist dominated listening (30%+ share)
- **Reflective Insights**: Four gradient stat cards displaying:
  - Longest listening streak (consecutive days)
  - Peak listening hour (most active time of day)
  - Favorite day of week (most active day)
  - Daily average streams
- Error handling with dismissible banners
- Loading states with Material-UI Skeleton components
- Responsive grid layout adapting to screen sizes

### Implementation

#### Backend
- Created discovery router at `/api/discovery` with four endpoints:
  - `GET /discovery/timeline` - Returns monthly artist discovery counts
  - `GET /discovery/loyalty?limit=20` - Returns loyalty metrics for top artists
  - `GET /discovery/obsessions?limit=15` - Returns obsession periods
  - `GET /discovery/reflect` - Returns reflective insights and stats
- Extended SpotifyDataLoader class with four new methods:
  - `get_discovery_timeline()`: Tracks first appearance of each artist, aggregates by month
  - `get_artist_loyalty()`: Calculates return probability (100/(1+avg_gap)) and half-life (median gap)
  - `get_artist_obsessions()`: Groups streams into 7-day windows, identifies periods with 30%+ artist share
  - `get_reflective_insights()`: Computes listening streaks, hour/day distributions, and generates insight messages
- Implemented efficient data processing with defaultdict and datetime handling
- Added proper timezone awareness for timestamp comparisons
- Included data filtering (minimum sessions, minimum window size) for quality results

#### Frontend
- Created DataTable component (`frontend/src/components/DataTable.tsx`):
  - Generic TypeScript component with Column interface
  - Supports custom formatting, alignment, and width per column
  - Sticky header for long tables
  - Loading skeleton with 5 placeholder rows
  - Empty state with customizable message
  - Keyboard navigation with focus indicators
  - ARIA labels for screen readers
- Fully implemented Discovery page:
  - Uses MUI X Charts (LineChart, BarChart)
  - Parallel data fetching with Promise.all for optimal performance
  - Four state objects for timeline, loyalty, obsessions, insights
  - Individual loading states for each section
  - Gradient stat cards using color palette from CLAUDE.md (#1c0b19 → #6fedb7)
  - Responsive Grid layout (12 columns on mobile, 6 on large screens)
  - Error handling with ErrorBanner component
  - Proper TypeScript typing throughout

#### Design
- Used color palette from CLAUDE.md consistently:
  - Dark purple (#1c0b19) → Federal blue (#140d4f) gradient for Longest Streak
  - Federal blue (#140d4f) → Keppel (#4ea699) gradient for Peak Hour
  - Keppel (#4ea699) → Emerald (#2dd881) gradient for Favorite Day
  - Emerald (#2dd881) → Aquamarine (#6fedb7) gradient for Daily Average
  - Charts use #2dd881 (emerald) for discovery timeline
  - Charts use #4ea699 (keppel) for obsession periods
- Responsive breakpoints: xs=12 (mobile), sm=6 (tablet), md=3 (desktop) for cards
- Consistent typography: h4 for page title, h6 for section headers, body2 for descriptions
- Proper spacing with sx prop and MUI theme spacing units

### Flow
1. User navigates to Discovery page via left drawer navigation
2. Page component mounts and triggers useEffect hook
3. Frontend fetches all four data sources in parallel via Promise.all:
   - Discovery timeline data
   - Artist loyalty data (top 20)
   - Obsession periods (top 15)
   - Reflective insights
4. Backend processes streaming data on-the-fly:
   - Identifies first artist appearances
   - Calculates listening gaps and loyalty metrics
   - Segments streams into weekly windows
   - Computes streaks and distributions
5. Data returns to frontend, updates state
6. Loading skeletons are replaced with:
   - LineChart showing discovery timeline
   - DataTable showing loyalty metrics
   - BarChart showing obsession periods
   - Gradient cards showing reflective insights
7. User can interact with charts (hover for tooltips)
8. User can navigate table with keyboard (tab, arrow keys)
9. If errors occur, ErrorBanner displays with dismiss option

### Usage
- Navigate to "Artist Discovery" page from the left drawer
- View **Discovery Timeline** chart to see when you discovered new artists over time
- Scroll through **Artist Loyalty** table to find artists you consistently return to:
  - Higher return probability = shorter gaps between listens
  - Lower half-life = faster return rate
- Review **Obsession Periods** chart to see weeks dominated by specific artists
- Check **Reflective Insights** cards for key stats:
  - Longest streak shows your most consistent listening period
  - Peak hour indicates when you listen most
  - Favorite day reveals your most active day of the week
  - Daily average shows typical listening volume
- All visualizations are responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 4: Milestones
  - Track listening streaks and breaks
  - Identify top listening days
  - Create "firsts" timeline (first play, first 100 streams, etc.)
  - Add flashback widget for specific dates
  - Export milestone summaries
- Consider adding filters/date range selectors to Discovery page
- Add sorting options to loyalty table (by return prob, half-life, or streams)
- Consider pagination for obsessions if user has many periods

## Conclusion
Phase 3 successfully implements artist discovery tracking and reflective insights, providing users with deep understanding of their music exploration patterns and loyalty behaviors. The reusable DataTable component and gradient stat cards establish design patterns for future phases. All features are accessible, responsive, and performant with parallel data fetching and proper error handling.
