## What Was Implemented

### Purpose
The Milestones feature serves as a personal achievement tracker and memory lane for users' listening history. It celebrates notable moments like:
- Consecutive listening streaks (3+ days)
- Peak listening days (50+ streams)
- First discoveries of favorite artists
- Days with exceptional musical diversity (20+ unique artists)

The Flashback widget allows users to revisit any specific date and see exactly what they were listening to, creating a nostalgic and engaging experience.

### Features

#### 1. Milestones List
- **Grouped by Year**: Milestones are organized chronologically by year, with the most recent year displayed first
- **Four Milestone Types**:
  - **Streaks** (üî•): Consecutive days of listening (3+ days)
  - **Peak Days** (üèÜ): Days with exceptional listening volume (50+ streams)
  - **Discoveries** (üéµ): First time listening to artists who became favorites
  - **Diversity** (üß≠): Days with exceptional musical variety (20+ unique artists)
- **Visual Badges**: Each milestone has a color-coded badge matching the brand palette:
  - Streaks: Emerald (#2dd881)
  - Peak Days: Keppel (#4ea699)
  - Discoveries: Aquamarine (#6fedb7)
  - Diversity: Federal Blue (#140d4f)
- **Rich Details**: Each milestone shows title, description, date, and type-specific icons

#### 2. Flashback Widget
- **Date Picker**: Select any date from listening history
- **Comprehensive Stats**:
  - Total streams and hours
  - Unique artists and tracks
  - Skip rate percentage
  - First and last stream times
  - Total listening duration
- **Top Lists**:
  - Top 5 artists for that day
  - Top 5 tracks for that day
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Export flashback summary with formatted text
- **Empty State Handling**: Gracefully handles dates with no listening data

#### 3. User Experience Enhancements
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for both milestones and flashback data
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with dismissible banners
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive list items with hover states
- **Snackbar Notifications**: Confirmation when flashback summary is copied
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle gradient for flashback cards using brand colors

### Implementation

#### Backend Implementation

**Data Loader Methods** (`data_loader.py`):
1. **`get_milestones_list()`**:
   - Analyzes entire streaming history
   - Identifies consecutive day streaks
   - Finds peak listening days (50+ streams threshold)
   - Tracks first artist discoveries (limited to top 20 artists)
   - Detects diversity days (20+ unique artists)
   - Returns sorted list by date (most recent first)

2. **`get_flashback(date_str)`**:
   - Accepts YYYY-MM-DD date format
   - Filters all records for that specific date
   - Calculates comprehensive statistics
   - Identifies top artists and tracks for the day
   - Returns detailed flashback object or error message

**Routes** (`milestones.py`):
- `GET /api/milestones/list` - Returns all milestones
- `GET /api/milestones/flashback?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Returns flashback data for specific date

#### Frontend Implementation

**TypeScript Types** (`api.ts`):
```typescript
interface Milestone {
  date: string;
  year: number;
  type: 'streak' | 'top_day' | 'first_artist' | 'diversity';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  value: number;
  badge_color: string;
}

interface FlashbackData {
  date: string;
  day_of_week: string;
  streams: number;
  hours: number;
  unique_artists: number;
  unique_tracks: number;
  skipped: number;
  skip_rate: number;
  first_stream: string | null;
  last_stream: string | null;
  listening_duration: string | null;
  top_artists: Array<{ artist: string; streams: number }>;
  top_tracks: Array<{ track: string; artist: string; plays: number }>;
  message?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

**Component Structure** (`Milestones.tsx`):
- State management for milestones, flashback data, and UI states
- `fetchMilestones()` - Loads milestones on component mount
- `fetchFlashback()` - Loads flashback data when user selects date
- `handleCopySummary()` - Formats and copies flashback data to clipboard
