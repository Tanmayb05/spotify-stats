Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs lock in a **phase-by-phase plan** where:

* **Before each phase**: we run a **Phase Setup** that adds any missing skeleton files, routes, types, envs, and doc tooling.
* **After each phase**: the webapp is **fully functional** (incrementally richer).
* **Each phase auto-generates a Markdown report** in `documentation/` named
  `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_phase_<number>_<name>.md`.
* We consistently apply your **UX, performance, security, and accessibility principles**.

Below are ready-to-paste **claude code prompts** for each phase. Use them one-by-one; each includes: setup ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí doc writing ‚Üí checklists & tests. Tech stack matches your request: **React + MUI + MUI X Charts** (frontend) and the backend you already have (or stubs, where noted).

# Phase 0 ‚Äî Project Skeleton & Doc Tooling (Foundations)

**Goal**: Create baseline structure, MUI theme, nav, routing, envs, and a doc-writer utility so every phase can emit a Markdown report automatically.

### ‚úÖ Phase Setup (skeleton)

**Paste to claude code:**

```
You are a senior full-stack engineer. In repo root, ensure this structure exists:

- /frontend (Vite + React + TS)
- /backend (FastAPI Python)  // keep minimal health endpoint if backend exists, else stub it
- /documentation             // markdown reports per phase

FRONTEND (Material UI + MUI X Charts):
1) Install deps:
   npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @mui/x-charts axios zustand
2) Add files:
   src/theme/AppThemeProvider.tsx
   src/layout/AppLayout.tsx
   src/components/StatCard.tsx
   src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx
   src/api/client.ts
   src/store/app.ts
   src/pages/Overview.tsx
   src/pages/Moods.tsx
   src/pages/Discovery.tsx
   src/pages/Milestones.tsx
   src/pages/Sessions.tsx
   src/pages/Recommendations.tsx
   src/pages/Simulator.tsx
   src/pages/NotFound.tsx
   src/utils/format.ts
   src/main.tsx
   src/App.tsx
- Dark theme by default; responsive typography; consistent spacing with sx.
- Left Drawer nav: Overview, Moods, Discovery, Milestones, Sessions, Recommendations (‚öóÔ∏è), Simulator (‚öóÔ∏è).
- AppBar with title and a (stub) theme toggle.
- Routes wired with react-router v6 and <AppLayout />.

DOCS TOOLING:
- Add /frontend/scripts/writePhaseDoc.ts (Node script) that writes a file:
  documentation/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>_phase_<number>_<name>.md
  with sections: date; phase; status; overview; time to complete; files created; files modified; checklist; what was implemented (purpose, features, implementation, flow, usage); next steps; conclusion.
- Add an npm script: "doc:phase": "ts-node scripts/writePhaseDoc.ts"
  (set up ts-node config if needed).

ACCESSIBILITY & SECURITY BASELINE:
- Global skip-to-content link.
- <CssBaseline />; prefers-reduced-motion check for animations (no blocking).
- Announce route changes to screen readers.
- Axios with baseURL from VITE_API_BASE_URL, sane timeouts, error interceptor.
- Don‚Äôt store secrets in frontend; rely on env.

Definition of Done:
- App builds and runs.
- Drawer navigation works; blank pages render.
- "Phase 0" doc created to /documentation.
Provide all new/changed files in full.
```

### üìÑ Documentation to create

* `documentation/<timestamp>_phase_0_foundations.md` (created by the script).

## Principles baked into every phase

* **User Experience & Interface**

  * Know your users: personal analytics first, power toggles second.
  * **Intuitive nav** via left Drawer; **consistency** of cards and charts.
  * **Visual hierarchy**: stat cards ‚Üí key charts ‚Üí secondary tables.
  * **Feedback**: skeletons while loading, error banners on failures.
  * **Progressive disclosure**: advanced tabs (‚öóÔ∏è) tucked away.
  * **Responsive**: MUI Grid breakpoints (`xs=12`, `md=6`, `lg=4`).

* **Performance & Technical**

  * Memoize derived series, avoid expensive re-renders.
  * Axios timeouts & retry (idempotent GETs).
  * API pagination for top lists.
  * Separation: `/frontend` vs `/backend`; typed API client.
  * Data minimization in responses.

* **Security & Trust**

  * No secrets in frontend; use env variables only for base URLs.
  * Sensible CORS; rate limit on backend if exposed.
  * Meaningful consent: if you later collect anything, show a clear notice.

* **Inclusivity & Accessibility**

  * Keyboard navigation, focus outlines intact.
  * Labels/aria for charts and controls.
  * Color is not the only cue; tooltips and legends included.
  * Check contrast via MUI theme palette.
